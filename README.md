Let's dive into the data:

Now you have a good understanding of the project and your role - it’s time to get to work!

Don’t worry if you haven’t done data analysis before, we’ll take you through each step and provide support along the way.

So, let’s have a look at what data you have to work with. The client has sent through:

7 data sets - each data set contains different columns and values
A data model - this shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.
There is a lot of information here and it’s easy to get lost in the data. So, to make sure you are using the right data to answer the business questions you’ll follow these steps:

Data sets - Quick Explanation
Great work! You’ve identified Reaction, Content, and Reaction Types as our relevant data sets.

To clarify why you made this selection:

The brief carefully it states that the client wanted to see “An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity”.
As explained in the data model, popularity is quantified by the “Score” given to each reaction type.
We therefore need data showing the content ID, category, content type, reaction type, and reaction score.
So, to figure out popularity, we’ll have to add up which content categories have the largest score.

But! Before we begin to work with the data sets, we’ll need to ensure that the data is clean and ready for analysis…
